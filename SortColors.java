/**
 * 
 * Given an array with n objects colored red, white or blue, sort them in-place 
 * so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue. 
 * Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

 * Approach
 * 
 * The Idea is to use the logic similar to 2 pivot quicksort's partition
 * procedure which is a modification of the original single pivot partition for
 * the case where there are duplicates in the array.
 * 
 * We can consider this instace to be a special case of the above described situation.
 * In a single pass we would be able to sort the given array.

 * Inplace and Linear Time Algorithm
